Description: Unicode-aware Pure Python Expect-like module
 Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications;
 controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in their output.
 Pexpect works like Don Libes' Expect. Pexpect allows your script to
 spawn a child application and control it as if a human were typing
 commands.
